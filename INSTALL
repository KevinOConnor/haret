Welcome.

This is HaRET, the Handheld Reverse Engineering Tool. For a detailed description
see the files in the docs/ directory. This file documents how to build and
install it.

HaRET is now compiled with the gcc toolset.  Previous versions (see
cvs tag haret-0_3_8 and earier) made use of the MSVC/ARM toolkit for
compiling.

The gcc toolset in use is from the cegcc project.  See
http://cegcc.sourceforge.net/ for more info.  This project is
currently still in active development (as of 20061111).  One may use
the following steps to obtain the same toolkit the main HaRET
developers are using:

1 - Obtain cegcc source (svn co
    https://svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/cegcc/trunk/cegcc)

2 - Use revision 777 (svn up -r 777)

3 - Apply the patch from HaRET CVS (patch -p0 <
    /path/to/haret/cegcc-20061111.patch)

4 - Optionally alter the build destination by modifying
    src/mingw32ce.sh.  If you do this, be sure to modify HaRET's
    makefile so that the BASE setting is the same.

5 - Build the cegcc toolset (cd src; ./build-mingw32ce.sh)

6 - Wait for toolchain to build.  The build may fail when trying to
    build gdb, but this isn't a problem.

7 - Build HaRET (cd /path/to/haret; make)
