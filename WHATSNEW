27-Feb-2004 v0.3.4
    -*- Stop all DMA controllers before booting Linux.

31-Jan-2004 v0.3.3
    -*- Added an dumper for the AC97 controller.

10-Jan-2004 v0.3.2
    -*- Made all dumpers generalized. The list of dumpers is available by
        typing 'HELP DUMP'.
    -*- Added a dumper for dumping GPIO state in a format suitable for
        generating include/asm-arm/arch-pxa/xxx-init.h files.
    -*- Enhanced memory size detection. Alas, Windows CE does not have
        a function that would directly return the amount of RAM in the PDA,
	so you have to use different tricks for this.
    -*- Renamed GPSR function to GPLR since it reads/sets the GPIO Level
        Register.
    -*- Renamed WATCHGPIO to WGPIO for shorter typing.
    -*- Added the SLEEP command for waiting given number of milliseconds.
    -*- Added the BWMEM command which will measure PDA's memory performance
        using Larry McVoy's lmbench routines. However, since the code is
	modified (although mostly cosmetically) from the original, the
	numbers should NOT be published as the results of lmbench, but
	rather as results of HaRET.
    -*- Fixed a bug that prevented you from assigning string variables longer
        than 100 characters (they were truncated to this length). I've found
	this while using a very long 'cmdline' variable.

15-Nov-2003 v0.3.1
    -*-	I've realised that HRET is quite hardly to pronounce for
	English-speaking people, so I've renamed the program to HaRET.
    -*-	Added a generalised mechanism for adding new functions. They are
	displayed along with variables now (SET LIST has been replved
	with HELP VARS). To get the value of a function, you do it like
	in normal high-level languages, e.g. 'PRINT "%x" VMW(0xa0000000)'
	or 'set CP(15,2) 0xa0010000'.
    -*- Added three functions: GPSR, GPDR, GAFR which allow reading/writing
	to GPIO control registers.
    -*-	Added DUMPGPIO command which displays in a readable format the state
	of the entire GPIO machinery.

14-Nov-2003 v0.3.0
    -*-	Added variables (SET command). Added the Linux kernel boot
	funcionality. Added a nice penguin shown during kernel loading :)
    -*-	Added a lot of new commands (PP[B|H|W/VP[B|H|W], WATCHGPIO,
	[V|P]WF and a lot more). Added functions (GPIO(), CP() etc).

16-Oct-2003 v0.2.1
    -*-	The first release meant to be public. Added the telnetd emulation code
	so that commands can be now nicely interactively edited. Added some
	docs about HRET (the most useful part is the description of HRET
	scripting language).

15-Oct-2003 v0.2.0
    -*-	This is the first release of what was once linexec. I hardly believe
	there is at least one original line left somewhere, however credits
	goes to original linexec authors Martin Demin, James Hicks, Joshua
        Wise (in no specific order) for things I've learned from linexec
	and also I'm grateful to Martin Demin for bringing the first
	Linux/Dell Axim port. I've learned lot from their code - hey,
	it's my first WinCE (and PDA) project.
